This project provides a visual representation of the linear search algorithm, allowing you to interactively add, remove, and search for elements in an array.

How to Use:
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/ristonrodrigues723/linear-search-visualization.git
Use code with caution.

Open the HTML File: Navigate to the project directory and open index.html in a web browser.
Interact with the Visualization:
Add Numbers: Enter a number in the "Number to add" field and click the "Add Number" button.
Remove Numbers: Enter a number in the "Number to remove" field and click the "Remove Number" button.
Clear Array: Click the "Clear Array" button to empty the array.
Generate Random Array: Click the "Generate Random Array" button to create a random array of numbers.
Search for a Number: Enter a number in the "Enter number to search" field and click the "Search" button. The visualization will highlight the search process and display the result.
Code Structure:
index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the user interface.
l.css: Styles the elements of the visualization.
l.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for handling user interactions and visualizing the linear search algorithm.
Linear Search Algorithm:
The linear search algorithm iterates through an array sequentially, comparing each element with the target value. If a match is found, the index of the element is returned. Otherwise, the algorithm continues until the end of the array, indicating that the target value was not found.

Additional Features:
Clear and Intuitive Interface: The visualization provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the array and observing the search process.
Visual Feedback: The visualization highlights the current element being compared during the search, making the algorithm's steps easy to follow.
Customizable Array: You can add, remove, and generate random arrays to test different scenarios.
